# JavaScript Clock Project

## Project Description
This project was focused on vanilla JavaScript that consisted of a clock that can be toggled between standard time or military time based on preference.

Deployed using Netlify:

## Purpose
The purpose behind this project was so that I can start putting my javascript knowledge to the test. I am currently looking to do more of the common beginner JavaScript focused projects so that I can increase my knowledge of the language and become an overall better web developer. More projects to come!

## Challenges encountered
There were four challenges that occurred throughout this project that stood out for me.
1. Learning the JS Date object was the first step in learning how to display the time.
2. For the the time being displayed in standard time, I wanted to ensure that the hours displayed with a leading zero. This was done so by adding a leading zero for any hour that is single digit.
3. For the the time being displayed in standard time, I did not like how AM and PM were displayed when using "hour12: true" in the toLocaleString() function so I ended up calculating whether it was AM or PM and then added it into its own <div> to have a better look.
4. Swapping between standard and military time. I ended up getting this done by creating two different html id attributes that I switched between based on what button was toggled.

## Concepts Learned and Practiced
1. JavaScript Date Object
2. setInterval() and clearInterval() Functions
3. Event Listeners
4. Creating Elements in JavaScript Files
5. Practice of CSS Styling and Code Documentation
